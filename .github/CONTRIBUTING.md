# Contributing to Ferrex

Thanks for your interest in improving Ferrex! This project aims to be welcoming and sustainable, while keeping early policies minimal and flexible.

## Ground Rules

- Be respectful and follow our Code of Conduct.
- Use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign‑off on every commit.
- Contributions are accepted under the project’s dual license (MIT OR Apache‑2.0).
- Report security issues privately (do not open public issues). See `SECURITY.md`.

## How to Contribute

1. Discuss: For substantial changes, please open an issue or discussion first.
2. Branch: Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Code: Keep changes focused and small when possible.
4. Test: Add or update tests when it makes sense for your change.
5. Style: Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test` locally.
6. Sign‑off: Use DCO sign‑off on every commit (see below).
7. PR: Open a pull request, describing the motivation and approach.

## DCO Sign‑off (Required)

Ferrex uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1. By contributing, you assert the statements in the DCO for your contribution. Include a Signed‑off‑by line on every commit:

```
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This adds a trailer like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

You can read the full DCO in `.github/DCO`.

## Licensing of Contributions

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Ferrex by you shall be dual‑licensed under the terms of the MIT license and the Apache License, Version 2.0, at your option, without any additional terms or conditions. See `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` for details.

## Code of Conduct

This project adopts the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. Please read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` before participating.

## Security

Please report security issues privately as described in `SECURITY.md`. Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities.

## Governance

Ferrex is currently a single‑maintainer project led by Grayson Hieb. The maintainer handles triage, reviews, and releases on a best‑effort basis. As the project grows, we may document a broader governance model and invite additional maintainers.

Until then:
- Prefer opening an issue or discussion before large/controversial changes.
- Expect response times to vary based on availability.
- Final decisions on scope, roadmap, and release readiness rest with the maintainer.
