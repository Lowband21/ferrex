# Ferrex Trademark Policy

“Ferrex” is a trademark (registered or unregistered) of Grayson Hieb. This policy explains permitted uses of the Ferrex name and related brand assets. It does not grant any rights under copyright licenses (MIT/Apache‑2.0) and does not limit your rights under those licenses.

I may update this policy to clarify guidance as the project grows.

## Allowed Uses (No Permission Required)

- Descriptive references to the project: e.g., “built with Ferrex”, “a plugin for Ferrex”, or “a fork of Ferrex”.
- Accurate, non‑misleading use in tutorials, articles, benchmarks, and reviews.
- Redistribution of unmodified source or binaries that include the name “Ferrex” solely to identify the software’s origin.

## Uses Requiring Permission

- Product or service names that could imply official status, sponsorship, or endorsement (e.g., “Ferrex Cloud”, “Ferrex Pro”, “Ferrex Enterprise”).
- Using “Ferrex” as the dominant element of a company, product, or domain name.
- Logos or visual brand elements (if and when published), except for fair use or as provided in official brand assets.

## Prohibited Uses

- Any use that is confusing, misleading, defamatory, or unlawful.
- Implying affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by the Ferrex project without permission.

## Domain Names and Social Handles

Please avoid registering domains or handles where “Ferrex” is the dominant component in a way that could cause confusion about official status. Fair, descriptive use in content is fine.

## Requesting Permission

If you’d like to use the Ferrex name in ways listed above as requiring permission, please contact the maintainer (via the channels listed in `SECURITY.md` or the maintainer’s GitHub profile) with details of your intended use.
